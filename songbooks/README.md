Songbooks
=========

(optional)
Notice how we include the songs.sty package by refering to it with a relative path
\usepackage[chorded]{../_styles/songs}

this may not be the most elegant way but it is certainly the easiest for everyone. If you want to install this style then read on ...

Before making a latex songbook in your computer you must install 'songs.sty'.
On a mac do this on a terminal (running from this folder)
$ sudo cp ./_style/songs.sty /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/
then run
$ sudo texhash
