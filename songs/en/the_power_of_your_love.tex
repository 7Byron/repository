\beginverse	
Lord, I come to You, let my heart be changed, renewed,
Flowing from the grace, 
That I found in You
Lord, I've come to know,
 The weaknesses I see in me,
Will be stripped away, 
By the power of Your love
\endverse

\beginchorus
Hold me close, 
Let Your love surround me
Bring me near, Draw me to Your side
And as I wait, I'll rise up like the eagle
And I will soar with You, 
Your Spirit leads me on
In the power of Your Love
\endchorus

\beginverse
\chordsoff
Lord unveil my eyes,
 Let me see You face to face
The knowledge of Your love, 
As You live in me
Lord renew my mind,
 As Your will unfolds in my life
In living every day, 
In the power of Your Love
