\[D]Yes, I've noticed all the bad news in the paper

\[D]I have never been more thrilled about tomorrow 
Sunshine's always bursting through the skies of \[A]gray 
I just feel like something good is about to \[Em]happen

\[Em]Brother, this could \[A]be (my sister) 
\[Em]Brother, this could \[A]be that very \[D]day
