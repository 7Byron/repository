\beginverse

Are you tired of chasing pretty rainbows?
Are you tired of spinnin' 'round and 'round?
Wrap up all the shattered dreams of your life,
And at the feet of Jesus, lay them down.

Give them all, give them all; 
Give them all to Jesus
Shattered dreams, wounded hearts, and broken toys
Give them all, give them all; 
Give them all to Jesus;
And He will turn your sorrow, into joy!
\endchorus

He never said you’d only see sunshine,
He never said there’d be no rain
He only promised a heart full of singing,
About the very things that once brought pain
