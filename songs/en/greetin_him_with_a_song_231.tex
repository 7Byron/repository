% section #1: verse 
\beginverse
I \[G]walked with the world for \[G7]many a mile,
and \[C]life was fun for a \[G]little while, but \[C]Jesus wasn't there,
How \[G]could I \[E7]smile? \[A7]How could I be happy for \[D7]long?
But \[G]how He's in my heart, oh \[G7]happy day!
He \[C]washed my sins and my \[G]guilt away.
And \[C]now he's coming to \[G]take us \[E7]home,
And we're \[A7]greetin' \[D7]him with a \[G]song
\endverse

% section #2: chorus 

\beginchorus
If \[G]Jesus didn't die for \[G7]me and you,
and \[C]heaven was just \[G]for a very few,
\[C]and not very many would make it through,
how could we be happy \[D7]long?
But \[G]Jesus didn't die for just \[G7]Peter and Paul.
Jesus \[C]came from heaven for to \[G]take us \[E7]home
and we're \[A7]greentin' \[D7]Him with a \[G]song.
\endchorus
