% section #1: verse 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\beginverse
There’s a \[D]lighthouse on the \[D7]hillside \[G]that overlooks \[D]the sea
When I’m tossed it sends out a lig\[E9/B]ht tha\[E7]t I might \[A]see.
\[A7]And the \[D]light that shines in \[D7]darkness, now wi\[Em7]ll safely lead us \[E7]o’er:
\[A7]If it w\[D]asn’t for the lighthouse\[D7 G], my ship would \[G/A A7 D]be no more.
\endverse

% section #2: chorus 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\beginchorus
And I thank\[D] God \[A7]for the \[G/D]ligh\[D]thouse\[D9G]! I owe my life \[Gm6 D]to Him.
For Jesus \[A7]is the \[G/D D]lighthouse, and \[E9]from \[E7]the rocks of \[A]sin.
\[D]He has shone a \[A7]light \[G/D]around \[D]me \[D9]that I\[G] could clea\[Gm6 D]rly see:
If it \[D]wasn’t for the lighthouse\[A7], where would this sh\[D]ip be?
\endchorus

% section #3: verse 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\beginverse
Ev’rybody that lives about us says, “Tear that lighthouse down
The big ships don’t sail this way anymore, There’s no use of it standing ‘round”.
Then my mind goes back to that stormy night When just in time I saw the light:
Yes, the light from that old lighthouse That stands up there on the hill.
\endverse
