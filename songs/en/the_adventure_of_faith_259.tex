\beginverse
\[Bb]He left everything behind and he went
\[F/A]Walking the path of the wind
\[Gm]Burning inside with a \[D#]passion that would never \[Bb A#]end
\[Gm]‘Cause on this morning eve\[Bb]rything had changed
\[F/A]Everything he had be\[F]lieved
\[D#/G]The day the one he was \[D#]fighting showed him he was \[Bb]blind
\[Gm]Nothing \[D#]ever sta\[Bb]ys the sa\[F/A]me
\[Gm]When we me\[D#]et the \[Bb]Lord who \[Fsus4 F]came

We’re not made for ordinary lives 				(Raparigas)
Cause the Maker of \[Bb/D Gm]all has great \[F]plans 		(Rapazes)
There is no\[D#]thing to \[Bb/D Gm]fear in His han\[F]ds 	(Raparigas)

% section #4: verse 

\beginverse
Today we can go with God on this way
Carried away by the wind
Trusting that whatever happens he‘ll always be there
Bearing a treasure within jars of clay
In our weaknesses we’ll see
That nothing’s impossible for those who dare to believe
Nothing ever stays the same
When we meet the Lord who came
\endverse
