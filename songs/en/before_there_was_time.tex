\beginverse
\[D]Before there was time, there were visions in \[A]Your mind
There was death in the \[Em]fall of mankind, but there \[G]was life in salvation’s design
Before there \[D]were days, There were nights I could \[A]not see Your face
But the night could not keep \[Em]me from grace, When \[G]You came and took my place
\endverse

So I cry \[A]holy only \[G]begotten \[D]Son of God \[A]Ancient of days
I cry holy only \[G]begotten Son of \[D]God And sing \[A]the praises (repete no fim)
Of the \[Em]one who saved me \[G]And the promises \[A]He made 
No fim: Before there was time

\beginverse
Before there was time You counted the hairs on my head
You knew all the words I’ve said And You purchased me back from the dead
Before I was made You searched me and knew my ways
You numbered all my days And You set forth the steps I would take
(Côro)
