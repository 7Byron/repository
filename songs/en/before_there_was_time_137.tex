% section #1: verse 

\beginverse

\[D]Before there was time, there were visions in \[A]Your mind
There was death in the \[Em]fall of mankind, but there \[G]was life in salvation’s design
Before there \[D]were days, There were nights I could \[A]not see Your face
But the night could not keep \[Em]me from grace, When \[G]You came and took my place

\endverse

So I cry \[A]holy only \[G]begotten \[D]Son of God \[A]Ancient of days
I cry holy only \[G]begotten Son of \[D]God And sing \[A]the praises (repete no fim)
Of the \[Em]one who saved me \[G]And the promises \[A]He made 
No fim: Before there was time

\endchorus

% section #3: verse 

\beginverse

Before there was time You counted the hairs on my head
You knew all the words I’ve said And You purchased me back from the dead
Before I was made You searched me and knew my ways
You numbered all my days And You set forth the steps I would take
(Côro)
(passagem)

\endverse
