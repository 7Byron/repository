\beginverse
É Teu Sangue que brilha em mim.
É Teu S\[F]angue que me dá a vi\[G]da.
É Teu S\[F]angue que tomo\[G]u lugar,
Rem\[C]indo em S\[Em]acrifíc\[Am]io,
E que me t\[F]orn\[Fm]a
Mais branco do que a n\[C]eve, \[G]do que a nev\[Am]e
Je\[F]sus, Prec\[G]ioso Sacrifício de Deus! ( n\[C  Em  Am]o fim repete )
