Ai nesse \[C]dia feliz
Em que eu a \[F]Cristo conheci
Jesus en\[C]trou-me no coração
Abençoou-me co\[C]m a salvação
Que dia fe\[C]liz.
Jesus entr\[G]ou! Na minha vida en\[C]trou.

Jesus hab\[G]ita no meu cora\[C]ção 
E desde ent\[G]ão minha vida mu\[C]dou
E desde ent\[G]ão minha vida transfor\[C]mou!
