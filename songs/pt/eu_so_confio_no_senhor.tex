Eu só con\[D]fio no Senhor para me g\[A]uiar,
Eu só confio no Senhor para cam\[D]inhar.
Se o céu chegar a escure\[D7]cer e o sol \[G]toldar;                          
Eu só con\[D]fio no Senh\[A]or, que não vai f\[D]altar.

Posso con\[A]fiar, posso co\[D]nfiar,

Se o céu chegar a escurecer e o sol \[G]toldar, 
Eu só con\[D]fio no Sen\[A]hor, que não v\[D]ai tardar.
