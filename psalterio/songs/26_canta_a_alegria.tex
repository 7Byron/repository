\beginverse
Vou \[F]cantando, na \[Bb]alegria \[C7]de \[F]viver,
A canção que toda a \[Bb]gente vai \[C7]apren\[F]der,
A can\[Bb]ção de \[C7]paz \[F]que \[C7]não tem \[F]dor,
A can\[Bb]ção de \[C7]paz, \[F]que \[C7]traz o \[F]amor,  
A canção do \[Bb]amor que \[C7]assim \[F]diz:
“Não há nada que te \[Bb]possa tornar \[C7]in\[F]feliz”.

\beginverse
De manhã, eu me levanto com o sol.
Nem a chuva diminui meu arrebol!
Pela tarde, eu canto um hino ao meu Senhor,
Pois eu sei que nunca é tarde para o amor.
Pela noite adentro eu vou cantar:
“Minha vida é um eterno caminhar.
\endverse
