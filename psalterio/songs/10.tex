O clarim que chama os crentes 
À batalha já soou 
Cristo à frente do seu povo 
Multidões já conquistou
O inimigo em retirada 
Seu fulgor patenteou 
Vencendo vem Jesus

E por fim entronizado 
As nações há-de julgar 
Todos grandes e pequenos 
O juiz hão-de encarar 
E os remidos triunfantes 
Em fulgor hão-de cantar 
Vencendo vem Jesus!
