\beginverse
Mon \[F]âme exal\[Dm]te le Sei\[GmC7]gneur,
Et mon esp\[Gm]irit se \[C]réjouit en \[F]Dieu, mon \[Gm]Sauveur,
\[C7]Parce qu’Il \[F]a jeté \[Dm]les yeux \[Dm C7]sur la basses\[Gm]se de sa \[C]servan\[F]te.
Car voi\[F]ci, désor\[Dm]mais
Toutes les \[Gm]génér\[C7]ations me di\[Gm]ront \[C]bie\[F]nheureuse,
Parce que le Tout-Pu\[Dm]issant a fait po\[Gm]ur moi
De grandes \[C7]choses.
Mon â\[Gm]me ex\[C]alte le Seig\[F]neur.
Son nom \[Gm]est \[C]saint, et sa m\[F]isé\[Dm]ricorde
S’étend \[G]d’\[D]âge en \[G]âge sur ceu\[C]x qui \[C7]le craignent.
Mon âm\[F]e exal\[Dm]te le Sei\[Gm C7]gneur,
Et mon es\[Gm]pirit se \[C]réjouit en \[F]Dieu, mon \[Gm]Sauveur, 
\[C7]Parce qu’\[F]Il a jeté \[Dm]les yeux \[Gm C7]sur la bassess \[Gm]e de sa \[C]servan\[F]te.
