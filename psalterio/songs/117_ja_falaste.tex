\[G]Já fa\[G7]laste alguma \[C]vez com \[D]Deus
Confiando-lhe os an\[G]seios \[Em]teus
Se o buscares em nome \[C]de \[D]Jesus
Ele te ouvi\[G]rá.\[G7]
Conta a Deus o que te a\[C]flige \[D]pois
O teu fardo é mais su\[G]ave a \[Em]dois
O melhor amigo é \[C]Cristo
\[D]Ele responde\[G]rá\[G7]
Mesmo ao envolver-te a \[C]multi\[D]dão
Podes segredar em \[G]ora\[Em]ção
Não precisas de cla\[C]mar
\[D]Deus lê teu cora\[G]ção\[G7]
