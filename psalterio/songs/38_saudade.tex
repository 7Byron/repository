\[A]Passarinhos, \[D]belas \[D7]flores, \[G]querem-me encan\[D]tar.
Oh, vãos te\[A7]rrestres \[D]esplen\[G]dores, \[D]não quero \[A7]aqui \[D]ficar!

\beginverse
Jesus me deu fiel promessa, vem-me buscar;
Meu coração está com pressa, eu quero já partir.
Meus pecados eram muitos, e culpado sou;
Mas o Seu sangue põe-me limpo, e para a Pátria vou.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\beginverse
Qual filho do seu lar saudoso eu quero ir;
Qual passarinho para o ninho, eu quero ao céu subir.
É fiel, a vinda é certa, quando não o sei,
Mas Ele me achará alerta; com Ele subirei.
\endverse
