\beginverse
Jama\[C]is compreenderei o \[F7+]Seu imenso Amor
Suport\[C]ou a aflição, para eu \[F7+]ter a Salvação.
Pa\[G]lavras eu não tenho para \[Am]Lhe agradecer
Mas eu \[Dm]sinto a esperança que me \[G]faz renascer.

Eu \[C]olho para a C\[Em]ruz, rep\[Am]aro que é Jesus.
\[Dm]Vejo no olhar, pedi\[G]ndo p’ra O amar...e sempre!
Preg\[C]ado ali na C\[Em]ruz \[Am]sinto que seduz.
Ol\[Dm]hando para a Cruz, eu v\[G]ejo a Jesus,

\beginverse
Compreendo agora então, o pecador que eu sou.
O seu sangue me lavou, e ao seu Pai me entregou
Pela graça sou liberto, redenção eu irei ter.
Ele a mim virá buscar, e o seu reino irá fundar
