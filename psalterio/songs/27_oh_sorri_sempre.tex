Tens \[F]alguns \[C7]te\[F]mores, muitos \[C7]di\[F]ssabores,
Mas \[C7]os \[F]nevo\[Bb]eiros se hão-de \[G G7 C7]dissipar.
Quando \[F]ao sorrires, \[C]confiante \[C7]vi\[F]res,
\[C]Que \[F]so\[G]rrir é a arma que \[C7]faz triunfar.

\beginverse
\chordsoff
Se trouxer-te o mundo um sofrer profundo,
Esperança ainda tens sempre em sorrir.
Teu pesar sofreia e o olhar alteia,
A sorrir contempla além o teu provir.

\beginverse
\chordsoff
Se estás bem triste, hoje não te riste,
Não murmures nunca, seja lá o que fôr;
O queixar rejeita, o sorriso enfeita,
E, sorrindo ajuda o mundo a ser melhor.
