\beginverse
A montanha me \[C]disse
O vale me \[Am]ensinou
Que o seu reino \[F]está \[G]tão \[G7]perto.
Neste sol de \[C]amargura, foge irmão da \[Am]loucura
Abandona o \[F]teu \[G]deserto
Um pássaro \[F]a viver, cantando a \[G]melodia
Na sua \[F]inocência \[G]infinita,
Faz-me \[F]sentir e sonhar
Nessa \[G]terra de paz, \[F]que o meu \[G]pensamento \[G7]agita.
\endverse

\[F]Por \[Am]isso \[G]irmão (3x),
